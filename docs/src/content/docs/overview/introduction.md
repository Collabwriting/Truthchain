Truthchain is an open-source project dedicated to combating misinformation and promoting truth in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, data verifiers, and user contributions, Truthchain aims to create a decentralized platform where users can collect, verify, and store data, ensuring its authenticity and credibility. This will bring to the forefront quality information, with reputable sources, as a way to build on shared knowledge and individual insights.

## How it Works
To understand how we plan on fighting misinformation, it's important to understand the basic concept how misinformation is created and how it spreads. Spreading misinformation is not always intentional, and is often the result of a lack of knowledge or the inability to verify the accuracy of information. Truthchain aims to combat misinformation by providing a platform for users to collect, verify, and store data, ensuring its authenticity and credibility and hopefully preventing the **_unintentional_** spread of misinformation.

### How Misinformation Spreads
Misinformation is spread through the sharing of information, whether it be through social media, news articles, or websites. This information is then consumed by other users, who may or may not be able to verify the accuracy of the information. This is where Truthchain comes in with providing a platform for users to collect, verify, and store data, ensuring its authenticity and credibility and hopefully preventing the **_unintentional_** spread of misinformation.

### How Truthchain Works
Truthchain is a platform where users can collect data from various online sources, such as news articles, social media posts, or websites, and submit it to Truthchain for verification. Truthchain implements data verification by creating interfaces to other services, known as Data Verifiers, that can verify the submitted data. These Data Verifiers employ various techniques to assess the accuracy and credibility of the information. Once the data passes the verification stage, the user who collected it digitally signs the information. This cryptographic signature serves as a unique identifier and ensures the integrity and authenticity of the data. Verified and signed data, along with its metadata, is stored on the blockchain using OriginTrail's ChatDKG. ChatDKG provides a decentralized knowledge graph, ensuring the immutability and transparency of the verified data.

## Key Features
**Data Collection**: Users can collect data from various online sources, such as news articles, social media posts, or websites, and submit it to Truthchain for verification.

**Data Verification**: Truthchain implements data verification by creating interfaces to other services, known as Data Verifiers, that can verify the submitted data. These Data Verifiers employ various techniques to assess the accuracy and credibility of the information.

**Digital Signatures**: Every piece of data that goes through Truthchain is digitally signed by the user who collected it. These digital signatures serve as proof of the data's origin and integrity.

**Blockchain Integration**: Truthchain leverages OriginTrail's ChatDKG, a Decentralized Knowledge Graph, for blockchain integration. Verified data, along with its metadata, is stored on the blockchain, creating an immutable and transparent record of verified information.
