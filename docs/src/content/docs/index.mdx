## Our Plan to Fight Misinformation

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Highlight & Save" icon="pencil">
		Collect any data found online and put it onto blockchain. That way information is saved, so even if source is changed or deleted, there's still a proof of it.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Verify Information" icon="magnifier">
		When data is on public blockchain it's verifiable by anyone. So you can be sure that information is not changed or faked.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Data Verifiers Plugins" icon="puzzle">
		Truthchain is developed so it has scaleable plugins for verification of different data types and sources.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Read the docs" icon="open-book">
		Learn more in [the Truthchain Docs](/guides/getting-started/).
