The OriginTrail tech stack is purposefully designed to bring real world assets into the Web3, enabling discoverability, verifiability and connectivity of physical and digital assets in one coherent Web3 data ecosystem. It is built on a set of tools and protocols evolving as the semantic layer of Web3. It is a two-layer system connecting blockchain technology on "Layer 1" and knowledge graph technology on "Layer 2", supporting the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).
